8-Puzzle Game – Greedy AI Solver
Project Description

This project implements the 8-Puzzle (3×3 sliding puzzle) and compares human gameplay with an AI solver using a Greedy strategy.
The puzzle is modeled as a graph, and the AI selects moves based on heuristic values.

Algorithms Used:
Graph Model:
Puzzle states are nodes, and legal tile moves are edges.

Greedy Best-First Search:
Chooses the next state with minimum heuristic value.

Heuristics:
Manhattan Distance
Linear Conflict

Sorting Algorithm:
Merge Sort is used to order states by heuristic cost.
Features
Dual board (User vs AI)
Image-based puzzle tiles
Guaranteed solvable shuffle
Step count comparison
Animated AI solution

Technologies Used:
Python
Tkinter
PIL (Pillow)
